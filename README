# Apex to Java

1. After changes to grammar files, use `mvn antlr4:antlr4` to generate Parser
   and Lexer code.
2. Parser and Lexer are generated under /target and inferred into classpath from
   there, no need to copy them anywhere else.
3. If you see wierd errors in terminal but no problem with the files, try following:
      - Run `mvn antlr4:antlr4` to generate antlr stuff again.
      - Rebuild project
      - maven install
